You can replace 80 with any desired port number.\n\nreference:\n\n```markdown:README.md\n    You can also specify a port:\n    ```console\n    $ grip 80\n    * Running on http://localhost:80/\n    ```\n```",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nYou can run grip on a specific port by specifying the port number as the second argument after the path. For example:\n```bash\ngrip path/to/file.md 8080\n# or\ngrip path/to/file.md localhost:8080\n```\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the docstring in `grip/command.py`, the command-line interface accepts two optional arguments:\n- `<path>`: The markdown file to render or directory containing README.md\n- `<address>`: Can be specified as either just a port number or as `host:port`\n\nThe usage pattern shows:\n```\ngrip [options] [<path>] [<address>]\n```\n\n**Details:**\nThe command supports two formats for specifying the port:\n1. Just the port number: `grip README.md 8080`\n2. Full address with host: `grip README.md localhost:8080`\n\nIf no port is specified, Grip will use its default port (typically 6419, though this isn't shown in the provided code snippet).\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The provided code snippet only shows the command-line interface documentation, not the actual implementation\n- The default port number isn't visible in the shown code\n- Any additional options that might affect port binding aren't shown in the snippet\n- Any validation or restrictions on valid port numbers aren't visible in the provided code\n\nTo provide more complete information, we would need to see the actual command parsing and server initialization code.\n\n**Sources:** grip/__init__.py, grip/__main__.py, grip/app.py, grip/command.py, grip/constants.py",

      "question": "Where does `wait_for_server` function is defined and what is its purpose?",
      "reference_answer": "The `wait_for_server` function, defined in `grip/browser.py`, waits until a local server starts listening on a given host and port. It repeatedly checks using `is_server_running`, sleeping for 0.1 seconds between attempts. If a `cancel_event` is provided and set, it exits early. It returns True when the server is ready. This function is used in `wait_and_start_browser` to ensure the server is running before opening the browser.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nThe `wait_for_server` function is defined in `grip/browser.py` and its purpose is to block execution until a server becomes available on the specified host and port. It continuously checks if a server is listening at the given address, with support for cancellation through an optional cancel event.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/browser.py`:\n```python\ndef wait_for_server(host, port, cancel_event=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Blocks until a local server is listening on the specified\n    host and port. Set cancel_event to cancel the wait.\n\n    This is intended to be used in conjunction with running\n    the Flask server.\n    \"\"\"\n    while not is_server_running(host, port):\n        # Stop waiting if shutting down\n        if cancel_event and cancel_event.is_set():\n            return False\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n    return True\n```\n\nThe function is used in conjunction with `wait_and_start_browser` and ultimately `start_browser_when_ready`, which creates a daemon thread to wait for the server to become available before opening a browser window.\n\n**Details:**\n- The function uses a while loop that checks server availability using `is_server_running`\n- It includes a cancellation mechanism through `cancel_event` parameter\n- Has a sleep interval of 0.1 seconds between checks to prevent CPU overuse\n- Returns True if the server becomes available, False if cancelled\n- Works in conjunction with socket-level checking implemented in `is_server_running`\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe code snippets show the complete implementation and usage context. However, it's worth noting that:\n- The actual timeout duration is not configurable\n- The sleep interval (0.1s) is hardcoded\n- There's no maximum wait time specified, so it could theoretically wait indefinitely if the server never starts\n\n**Sources:** grip/api.py, grip/app.py, grip/browser.py, grip/command.py",

They represent the file extensions that GitHub officially supports for markdown files.\n\n**Details:**\n- The extensions are used to identify valid markdown files\n- They are combined with supported titles (README, Readme, readme, Home) to create valid default filenames\n- The constant is exported in `grip/__init__.py` as part of the public API (`__all__` list)\n- These extensions align with GitHub's markup specifications, as noted in the comment: \"as defined by https://github.com/github/markup\"\n\n**Limitations:**\nWhile the code clearly defines which extensions are supported, it doesn't provide a mechanism for extending or modifying this list at runtime. If there was a need to support additional markdown extensions, the constant would need to be modified in the source code.\n\n**Sources:** grip/__init__.py, grip/app.py, grip/constants.py, grip/renderers.py, grip/vendor/six.py",

In `TextReader.read()` when trying to access an unsupported subpath\n2. In `DirectoryReader._find_file()` when no README file is found in the specified directory\n3. In file operations when a README file cannot be read\n\n**Details:**\nUsage example:\n```python\n# Example 1: Raising the exception with a path\nraise ReadmeNotFoundError(\"/path/to/missing/README.md\")\n\n# Example 2: Raising with both path and custom message\nraise ReadmeNotFoundError(\"/path/to/dir\", \"Custom README not found message\")\n\n# Example 3: Handling the exception\ntry:\n    reader.read(\"subpath/README.md\")\nexcept ReadmeNotFoundError as e:\n    print(str(e))  # Will print either custom message or \"No README found at /path/to/README.md\"\n```\n\nWhen the exception is raised:\n- If a message is provided, str(error) returns that message\n- If only a path is provided, it returns \"No README found at {path}\"\n- If neither is provided, it returns the default strerror (\"README not found\")\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe code snippets don't show all possible use cases where this exception might be caught and handled. The complete error handling strategy across the entire application would require additional context from other parts of the codebase.\n\n**Sources:** grip/exceptions.py, grip/readers.py",

      "reference_answer": "The `DirectoryReader` class, defined in `grip/readers.py`, is a subclass of `ReadmeReader` that reads README files from a directory. It locates a README file, normalizes paths, and provides methods to read file content (text or binary), determine file types, and track last modification times. It ensures safe access by preventing traversal outside the root directory. If no README is found, it either returns a default filename (if silent=True) or raises `ReadmeNotFoundError`.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nThe `DirectoryReader` class is a specialized implementation of `ReadmeReader` that handles reading README files from local filesystem directories. Its primary purpose is to locate and read README files either from a specified path or from the current working directory, supporting multiple default README filenames.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/readers.py`, the `DirectoryReader` class inherits from `ReadmeReader` and implements two key methods:\n\n1. `_find_file()`: Searches for README files in a given directory using predefined filenames\n2. `_resolve_readme()`: Resolves the actual README file path, handling both direct file paths and directory paths\n\nThe class is used as the default reader in `grip/app.py` when initializing the Grip application:\n```python\nif source is None or isinstance(source, str_type):\n    source = DirectoryReader(source)\n```\n\n**Details:**\nThe implementation includes several key features:\n\n1. Path Resolution:\n```python\ndef __init__(self, path=None, silent=False):\n    super(DirectoryReader, self).__init__()\n    root_filename = os.path.abspath(self._resolve_readme(path, silent))\n    self.root_filename = root_filename\n    self.root_directory = os.path.dirname(root_filename)\n```\n\n2. File Finding Logic:\n- Searches for README files using predefined filenames\n- Supports silent mode which returns a default filename instead of raising errors\n- Handles both direct file paths and directory paths\n- Normalizes paths for consistency\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Raises `ReadmeNotFoundError` when no README file is found (unless in silent mode)\n- Provides detailed error messages with file paths\n\n**Limitations:**\nWhile the code context shows the core functionality, there are a few elements not visible in the provided snippets:\n\n1.

      "question": "How does Grip handle the rendering of GitHub-style task lists with nested items, and what HTML structure does it generate? \nPlease provide an example of the Markdown input and corresponding HTML output.",
      "reference_answer": "Let me explain how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists by analyzing the test files and HTML output structure:\n\nThe input Markdown for nested task lists looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] a bigger project\n  - [x] first subtask #1234\n  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321\n  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention\n- [x] a separate task\n```\n\nGrip generates specific HTML structure for these task lists, as shown in the test output:\n\n\n```664:666:tests/output/app/gfm-test-user-content.html\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" disabled> a bigger project\n```\n\n\nThe key elements of the HTML structure are:\n\n1. Task lists get the class `task-list`\n2. Each list item gets the class `task-list-item`\n3. Checkboxes are rendered as `input` elements with:\n   - type=\"checkbox\"\n   - class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"\n   - disabled attribute\n   - checked attribute for completed tasks\n\nFor nested lists, Grip maintains the hierarchy by:\n\n\n```466:474:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> a bigger project\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> first subtask #1234</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> follow up subtask #4321</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> final subtask cc @mention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> a separate task</li>\n```\n\n\nThis shows that:\n\n1. The parent list contains the nested list within its `li` element\n2. The nested list maintains all the same task list classes and structure\n3. Each level preserves the checkbox state (checked/unchecked)\n4. References like #1234 and @mention are properly linked in the HTML output\n\nThis implementation matches GitHub's own rendering of task lists, ensuring compatibility and consistent appearance when viewing markdown files either on GitHub or through Grip's local preview.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, I cannot definitively determine how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists with nested items. The code shown does not contain the specific implementation details for task list rendering.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the code provided, we can see that Grip uses GitHub's Markdown API for rendering through the `GitHubRenderer` class in `grip/renderers.py`. The rendering is delegated to GitHub's API rather than being handled locally:\n\n```python\nclass GitHubRenderer(ReadmeRenderer):\n    def __init__(self, user_content=None, context=None, api_url=None, raw=None):\n        if api_url is None:\n            api_url = DEFAULT_API_URL\n        super(GitHubRenderer, self).__init__(user_content, context)\n        self.api_url = api_url\n```\n\nThe actual rendering happens through the `render()` method, but the provided code only shows input validation and doesn't include the API call implementation or HTML generation logic.\n\n**Details:**\nThe rendering process appears to:\n1. Take markdown text as input\n2. Validate that the input is a Unicode string\n3. Presumably send the content to GitHub's API (implementation not shown)\n4. Return the rendered HTML (implementation not shown)\n\n**Limitations:**\nSeveral key pieces of information are missing from the provided code:\n1. The actual API call implementation to GitHub's Markdown API\n2. The specific handling of task lists and nested items\n3. The HTML transformation logic\n4. Any custom processing of GitHub-specific markdown features\n5. The complete implementation of the `render()` method\n\nTo fully answer this question, we would need to see:\n- The complete implementation of the `GitHubRenderer.render()` method\n- Any custom markdown processors or filters\n- The actual API response handling code\n- Any HTML post-processing that might occur\n\nThe actual rendering appears to be delegated to GitHub's API, so the HTML structure would likely match GitHub's standard output format for task lists, but we cannot confirm this from the provided code alone.\n\n**Sources:** grip/__main__.py, grip/command.py, grip/constants.py, setup.py",

      "question": "How does Grip handle GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, and what happens when invalid credentials are provided? Please explain the authentication flow and error handling.",
      "reference_answer": "Based on the codebase, particularly the test mocks implementation, here's how Grip handles GitHub API authentication:\n\nWhen making requests to GitHub's API, Grip uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the following flow:\n\n1. Authentication headers are checked first:\n\n```python:tests/mocks.py\ndef _authenticate(self, request):\n    if 'Authorization' not in request.headers:\n        return None\n    dummy = requests.Request()\n    requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(*self.auth)(dummy)\n    if request.headers['Authorization'] != dummy.headers['Authorization']:\n        return (401, {'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'},\n                '{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}')\n    return None\n```\n\nKey aspects of the authentication handling:\n\n1. If no Authorization header is present, requests are treated as unauthenticated (subject to stricter rate limits)\n2. When credentials are provided, they're validated using HTTP Basic Auth\n3. Invalid credentials result in a 401 response with a JSON error message: `{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}`\n\nThe authentication is important because GitHub's API has rate limiting:\n- Unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour\n- Authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour\n\nThis means that for heavy usage or in environments where you need to render many markdown files, proper authentication is crucial to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\nWhen using Grip, you can provide GitHub credentials either through:\n- Environment variables\n- Command line arguments\n- API configuration\n\nIf invalid credentials are provided, Grip will receive the 401 error from GitHub and fall back to unauthenticated requests, but with the lower rate limit.\n\nThis implementation ensures secure handling of credentials while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's API requirements and rate limiting policies.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip handles GitHub API authentication through basic authentication using a username/password or token combination. The authentication is optional, and credentials can be specified through settings or command-line arguments.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\n1. From `settings.py`:\n```python\n# Default settings with credentials\nUSERNAME = None\nPASSWORD = None\n```\n\n2. From `api.py`:\n```python\n# Optional basic auth implementation\nauth = (username, password) if username or password else None\n```\n\n3. From `command.py`, the CLI supports authentication options:\n```python\n--user=<username> A GitHub username for API authentication\n--pass=<password> A GitHub password or auth token for API auth\n```\n\n**Details:**\nThe authentication flow appears to work as follows:\n\n1. Credentials can be provided through:\n   - Settings file (`settings.py`)\n   - Command line arguments (`--user` and `--pass`)\n   - Environment variables (not shown in provided snippets)\n\n2. The authentication tuple is created only if either username or password is provided\n3.

      "question": "How does Grip handle syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks, and what happens when an unmatched language is specified? Explain the rendering process with examples.",
      "reference_answer": "Looking at the test files and HTML output, here's how Grip handles code block syntax highlighting:\n\nWhen processing a markdown code block, Grip generates different HTML structures based on the language specification:\n\n1. For recognized languages, it generates a `highlight` div with language-specific class:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test.html\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">'Hello!'</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'JavaScript!'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n```\n\n2. For unmatched languages, it falls back to a simpler structure:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<pre lang=\"unmatched_language\"><code>console.log('No matching language, but looks like JavaScript.');\n</code></pre>\n```\n\nThe key differences in handling are:\n\n1. Recognized languages:\n   - Get wrapped in a `div` with `highlight` and `highlight-source-{language}` classes\n   - Receive syntax-specific span elements with `pl-` prefixed classes for different code elements\n   - Support proper coloring of syntax elements like strings, functions, and operators\n\n2. Unmatched languages:\n   - Use a simpler `pre` and `code` structure\n   - Include the unmatched language as a `lang` attribute\n   - Don't receive any syntax-specific highlighting\n\nThis matches GitHub's own rendering behavior, ensuring that code blocks look the same whether viewed on GitHub or through Grip's local preview, while gracefully handling unsupported language specifications.\n\nThe syntax highlighting is particularly important for technical documentation, as it makes code examples more readable and helps distinguish different programming languages in the rendered output.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip primarily handles syntax highlighting through two paths: GitHub's API rendering (GitHubRenderer) or offline rendering (OfflineRenderer) using Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension. The offline rendering specifically uses the 'codehilite' extension with the CSS class 'highlight'.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/renderers.py`, we can see two main rendering implementations:\n\n1. GitHubRenderer:\n- Sends markdown content to GitHub's API for rendering\n- Preserves GitHub's native syntax highlighting behavior\n- The actual syntax highlighting implementation is handled by GitHub's backend\n\n2. OfflineRenderer:\n```python\nreturn markdown.markdown(text, extensions=[\n    'fenced_code',\n    'codehilite(css_class=highlight)',\n    'toc',\n    'tables',\n    'sane_lists',\n    UrlizeExtension(),\n])\n```\n- Uses Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension\n- Sets CSS class to 'highlight' for styled code blocks\n- Supports fenced code blocks through the 'fenced_code' extension\n\n**Details:**\nThe syntax highlighting process differs depending on the renderer:\n\n1. With GitHubRenderer:\n- Language detection and highlighting are handled by GitHub's API\n- Unmatched languages would fall back to GitHub's default handling\n\n2. With OfflineRenderer:\n- Highlighting is handled by Python-Markdown's codehilite extension\n- Unmatched languages would likely be rendered as plain text\n- The 'fenced_code' extension enables support for triple-backtick code blocks with language specifications\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe provided code doesn't show:\n1.
