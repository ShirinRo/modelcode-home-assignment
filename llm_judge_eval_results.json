    "question": "How does Grip handle the rendering of GitHub-style task lists with nested items, and what HTML structure does it generate? \nPlease provide an example of the Markdown input and corresponding HTML output.",
    "reference_answer": "Let me explain how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists by analyzing the test files and HTML output structure:\n\nThe input Markdown for nested task lists looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] a bigger project\n  - [x] first subtask #1234\n  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321\n  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention\n- [x] a separate task\n```\n\nGrip generates specific HTML structure for these task lists, as shown in the test output:\n\n\n```664:666:tests/output/app/gfm-test-user-content.html\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" disabled> a bigger project\n```\n\n\nThe key elements of the HTML structure are:\n\n1. Task lists get the class `task-list`\n2. Each list item gets the class `task-list-item`\n3. Checkboxes are rendered as `input` elements with:\n   - type=\"checkbox\"\n   - class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"\n   - disabled attribute\n   - checked attribute for completed tasks\n\nFor nested lists, Grip maintains the hierarchy by:\n\n\n```466:474:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> a bigger project\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> first subtask #1234</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> follow up subtask #4321</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> final subtask cc @mention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> a separate task</li>\n```\n\n\nThis shows that:\n\n1. The parent list contains the nested list within its `li` element\n2. The nested list maintains all the same task list classes and structure\n3. Each level preserves the checkbox state (checked/unchecked)\n4. References like #1234 and @mention are properly linked in the HTML output\n\nThis implementation matches GitHub's own rendering of task lists, ensuring compatibility and consistent appearance when viewing markdown files either on GitHub or through Grip's local preview.",
    "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, I cannot definitively determine how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists with nested items.

    "question": "How does Grip handle GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, and what happens when invalid credentials are provided? Please explain the authentication flow and error handling.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the codebase, particularly the test mocks implementation, here's how Grip handles GitHub API authentication:\n\nWhen making requests to GitHub's API, Grip uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the following flow:\n\n1. Authentication headers are checked first:\n\n```python:tests/mocks.py\ndef _authenticate(self, request):\n    if 'Authorization' not in request.headers:\n        return None\n    dummy = requests.Request()\n    requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(*self.auth)(dummy)\n    if request.headers['Authorization'] != dummy.headers['Authorization']:\n        return (401, {'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'},\n                '{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}')\n    return None\n```\n\nKey aspects of the authentication handling:\n\n1. If no Authorization header is present, requests are treated as unauthenticated (subject to stricter rate limits)\n2. When credentials are provided, they're validated using HTTP Basic Auth\n3. Invalid credentials result in a 401 response with a JSON error message: `{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}`\n\nThe authentication is important because GitHub's API has rate limiting:\n- Unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour\n- Authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour\n\nThis means that for heavy usage or in environments where you need to render many markdown files, proper authentication is crucial to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\nWhen using Grip, you can provide GitHub credentials either through:\n- Environment variables\n- Command line arguments\n- API configuration\n\nIf invalid credentials are provided, Grip will receive the 401 error from GitHub and fall back to unauthenticated requests, but with the lower rate limit.\n\nThis implementation ensures secure handling of credentials while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's API requirements and rate limiting policies.",
    "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip handles GitHub API authentication through basic authentication using a username/password (or token) pair.

In `settings.py`:\n```python\nUSERNAME = None\nPASSWORD = None\n```\nDefault credentials are set to None, with a comment recommending using a personal access token instead of password for security.\n\n2. In `api.py`:\n```python\nauth = (username, password) if username or password else None\n```\nThe authentication tuple is only created if either username or password is provided.\n\n3. In `command.py`, the CLI options show authentication parameters:\n```\n--user=<username> A GitHub username for API authentication\n--pass=<password> A GitHub password or auth token for API auth\n```\n\n**Details:**\nThe authentication flow appears to work as follows:\n\n1. Credentials can be provided through:\n   - Command line arguments (--user and --pass)\n   - Settings configuration (USERNAME and PASSWORD variables)\n   - Personal access token (recommended in comments)\n\n2.

    "question": "How does Grip handle syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks, and what happens when an unmatched language is specified? Explain the rendering process with examples.",
    "reference_answer": "Looking at the test files and HTML output, here's how Grip handles code block syntax highlighting:\n\nWhen processing a markdown code block, Grip generates different HTML structures based on the language specification:\n\n1. For recognized languages, it generates a `highlight` div with language-specific class:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test.html\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">'Hello!'</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'JavaScript!'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n```\n\n2. For unmatched languages, it falls back to a simpler structure:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<pre lang=\"unmatched_language\"><code>console.log('No matching language, but looks like JavaScript.');\n</code></pre>\n```\n\nThe key differences in handling are:\n\n1. Recognized languages:\n   - Get wrapped in a `div` with `highlight` and `highlight-source-{language}` classes\n   - Receive syntax-specific span elements with `pl-` prefixed classes for different code elements\n   - Support proper coloring of syntax elements like strings, functions, and operators\n\n2. Unmatched languages:\n   - Use a simpler `pre` and `code` structure\n   - Include the unmatched language as a `lang` attribute\n   - Don't receive any syntax-specific highlighting\n\nThis matches GitHub's own rendering behavior, ensuring that code blocks look the same whether viewed on GitHub or through Grip's local preview, while gracefully handling unsupported language specifications.\n\nThe syntax highlighting is particularly important for technical documentation, as it makes code examples more readable and helps distinguish different programming languages in the rendered output.",
    "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip primarily handles syntax highlighting through two paths: GitHub's API rendering (GitHubRenderer) or offline rendering (OfflineRenderer) using Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension. The offline rendering specifically uses the 'codehilite' extension with the CSS class 'highlight'.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/renderers.py`, we can see two main rendering implementations:\n\n1. GitHubRenderer:\n- Sends markdown content to GitHub's API for rendering\n- Preserves GitHub's native syntax highlighting behavior\n- The actual syntax highlighting implementation is handled by GitHub's backend\n\n2. OfflineRenderer:\n```python\nreturn markdown.markdown(text, extensions=[\n    'fenced_code',\n    'codehilite(css_class=highlight)',\n    'toc',\n    'tables',\n    'sane_lists',\n    UrlizeExtension(),\n])\n```\n- Uses Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension\n- Sets CSS class to 'highlight' for styled code blocks\n- Supports fenced code blocks through the 'fenced_code' extension\n\n**Details:**\nThe syntax highlighting process differs depending on the renderer:\n\n1. With GitHubRenderer:\n- Language detection and highlighting are handled by GitHub's API\n- Unmatched languages likely fall back to GitHub's default handling\n- The actual implementation details are abstracted away in GitHub's service\n\n2. With OfflineRenderer:\n- Highlighting is handled by Python-Markdown's codehilite extension\n- The extension typically uses Pygments for syntax highlighting\n- Unmatched languages would likely be rendered as plain text blocks\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe provided code snippets don't show:\n1. The actual CSS styles used for highlighting\n2. How language-specific syntax highlighting rules are implemented\n3. The exact fallback behavior for unmatched languages\n4. The complete configuration options for the codehilite extension\n5. Whether there are any language-specific optimizations or customizations\n\nTo fully understand the syntax highlighting behavior, we would need to see:\n- The CSS styling implementation\n- The complete Pygments integration (if any)\n- Any custom language definitions\n- The actual HTML output generation process\n- Any additional configuration files for syntax highlighting\n\n**Sources:** grip/__main__.py, grip/api.py, grip/command.py, grip/renderers.py",
