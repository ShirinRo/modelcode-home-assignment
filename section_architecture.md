# Architecture

## Overview
Grip is structured as a modular Flask-based application that provides both programmatic and command-line interfaces for rendering GitHub-flavored Markdown. The system employs a clean separation of concerns with distinct modules handling specific responsibilities, from file operations to web serving capabilities.

## Entry Points
The application provides two primary methods of interaction:

### Programmatic Interface
- Main entry point: `serve()` function in `grip/api.py`
- Designed for library usage and programmatic integration
- Provides a flexible API for rendering and serving Markdown content

### Command-Line Interface
- Implemented in `grip/command.py`
- Enables direct command-line usage
- Provides CLI arguments for controlling rendering and server options

## Core Module Architecture

The system is organized into logical modules with clear responsibilities:

### Primary Modules

#### Application Core (`grip/app.py`)
- Houses the central Flask application implementation
- Manages web server functionality and request routing
- Handles GitHub asset processing and rendering logic
- Acts as the backbone of the web serving capabilities

#### Public API (`grip/api.py`)
- Serves as the main public interface layer
- Orchestrates interactions between readers and renderers
- Provides high-level operations for client code
- Abstracts implementation details from end users

#### File Operations (`grip/readers.py`)
- Manages all file system interactions
- Implements directory traversal and file handling
- Handles README file discovery and reading
- Provides abstraction for file access operations

### Supporting Infrastructure

#### Package Initialization (`grip/__init__.py`)
- Defines the public API surface
- Manages version information
- Controls exported functionality
- Serves as the main package entry point

#### Compatibility Layer (`grip/vendor/six.py`)
- Ensures cross-version Python compatibility
- Provides utility functions for Python 2/3 support

## Architectural Patterns

The codebase demonstrates several key architectural patterns:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between web serving, file operations, and rendering logic
- **Modular Design**: Well-defined modules with specific responsibilities
- **API Abstraction**: Clean public interface hiding implementation details
- **Flexibility**: Support for both programmatic and CLI usage
- **Compatibility**: Built-in support for cross-version Python compatibility

## Technical Considerations

- Built on Flask framework for web serving capabilities
- Implements GitHub-flavored Markdown rendering
- Maintains clear boundaries between components
- Provides extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Follows Python package structure best practices

This architecture enables the system to serve as both a standalone tool and an embeddable library while maintaining clean separation between components and clear responsibility boundaries.
