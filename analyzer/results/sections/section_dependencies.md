# Dependencies Analysis

## Overview
The dependency analysis of this codebase is currently incomplete, as the primary source for external package information (setup.py) needs to be examined in detail. This section will be updated once specific dependency data becomes available.

## Current State
- Full dependency list pending analysis of setup.py file
- Further investigation required for comprehensive external package inventory

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. Review setup.py file to document:
   - Required packages
   - Version constraints
   - Optional dependencies

### Future Improvements
1. Implement dependency documentation practices:
   - Maintain a comprehensive dependency inventory
   - Document version requirements
   - Track dependency update history

## Next Steps
- [ ] Analyze setup.py file contents
- [ ] Document all external package dependencies
- [ ] Review any additional requirement files (requirements.txt, etc.)
- [ ] Assess dependency health and maintenance status

## Note
This section will be expanded once detailed dependency information becomes available through setup.py analysis and further codebase examination. The goal is to provide a complete picture of:
- External package dependencies
- Version requirements
- Integration points
- Critical dependencies
- Optional dependencies
