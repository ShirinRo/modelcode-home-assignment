# Architecture Overview

## Entry Points and Application Bootstrap

The application follows a dual-entry point architecture, providing flexibility for both programmatic and command-line usage. This design pattern enables the system to be used as both a library and a standalone tool.

### Primary Entry Points

The application's bootstrap mechanism is distributed across two key components:

- **Main Function Entry (`grip/__init__.py`)**
  - Serves as the primary programmatic interface
  - Exports the `main()` function for library usage
  - Enables integration into other Python applications

- **Command Line Interface (`grip/command.py`)**
  - Handles CLI-based execution
  - Provides command-line argument parsing and processing
  - Serves as the entry point for terminal usage

### Architecture Insights

The dual-entry point architecture offers several advantages:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear distinction between programmatic and CLI usage
   - Modular design allowing for independent evolution of interfaces

2. **Integration Flexibility**
   - Library consumers can utilize the `main()` function directly
   - Command-line users benefit from a dedicated CLI interface
   - Supports both scripting and interactive usage patterns

3. **Maintainability**
   - Isolated entry points reduce coupling
   - Changes to CLI handling don't affect library consumers
   - Clear boundaries for testing and modification

## Recommendations

Based on the architectural analysis, consider:

- Documenting the specific responsibilities of each entry point
- Ensuring consistent error handling across both interfaces
- Maintaining clear separation between CLI parsing and core logic
- Adding interface stability guarantees for library consumers

This architecture provides a solid foundation for both library and tool usage, though further analysis of the specific implementation details would be beneficial for a complete assessment.
