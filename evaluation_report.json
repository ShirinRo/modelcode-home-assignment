You can replace 80 with any desired port number.\n\nreference:\n\n```markdown:README.md\n    You can also specify a port:\n    ```console\n    $ grip 80\n    * Running on http://localhost:80/\n    ```\n```",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nYou can run grip on a specific port by specifying the port number as the second argument after the path. For example:\n```bash\ngrip path/to/file.md 8080\n# or\ngrip path/to/file.md localhost:8080\n```\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the code in `grip/command.py`, the command-line interface documentation shows that grip accepts two optional arguments:\n- `<path>`: The file to render or directory containing README.md\n- `<address>`: Can be specified as either just a port number or as `host:port`\n\nThe usage pattern shown in the docstring:\n```\ngrip [options] [<path>] [<address>]\n```\nindicates that both path and address are optional arguments, with address being the second positional argument.\n\n**Details:**\nThe address parameter can be specified in two formats:\n1. Just the port number (e.g., `8080`)\n2. Full host:port format (e.g., `localhost:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080`)\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe provided code snippet only shows the command-line interface documentation. The actual port handling implementation is not visible in the given context. To provide more specific details about:\n- Default port if none specified\n- Valid port ranges\n- How the port binding actually works\nwe would need to see additional code from the implementation.\n\n**Sources:** grip/__init__.py, grip/__main__.py, grip/app.py, grip/command.py, grip/constants.py",

It repeatedly checks using `is_server_running`, sleeping for 0.1 seconds between attempts. If a `cancel_event` is provided and set, it exits early. It returns True when the server is ready. This function is used in `wait_and_start_browser` to ensure the server is running before opening the browser.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nThe `wait_for_server` function is defined in `grip/browser.py` and its purpose is to block execution until a server becomes available on the specified host and port. It continuously checks if a server is listening at the given address, with optional cancellation support.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/browser.py`:\n```python\ndef wait_for_server(host, port, cancel_event=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Blocks until a local server is listening on the specified\n    host and port.

In file reading operations when encountering ENOENT (No such file or directory) errors\n\n**Details:**\nUsage example:\n```python\n# Example 1: Basic usage\ntry:\n    reader = DirectoryReader(\"/path/to/directory\")\nexcept ReadmeNotFoundError as e:\n    print(str(e))  # Outputs: \"No README found at /path/to/directory\"\n\n# Example 2: Custom message\nraise ReadmeNotFoundError(\n    path=\"/some/path\",\n    message=\"Custom README not found message\"\n)\n\n# Example 3: As seen in TextReader\nif subpath is not None:\n    raise ReadmeNotFoundError(subpath)\n```\n\nThe exception provides three ways to get the error message:\n1. Custom message if provided\n2. Formatted path message if path is provided\n3. Default strerror from parent class\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe code snippets show the exception being raised in several contexts, but we don't see all possible use cases. The complete set of situations where this exception might be raised would require reviewing the entire codebase, particularly around file operations and README file handling.\n\n**Sources:** grip/exceptions.py, grip/readers.py",

      "question": "`DirectoryReader` - please explain the purpose of the class.",
      "reference_answer": "The `DirectoryReader` class, defined in `grip/readers.py`, is a subclass of `ReadmeReader` that reads README files from a directory. It locates a README file, normalizes paths, and provides methods to read file content (text or binary), determine file types, and track last modification times. It ensures safe access by preventing traversal outside the root directory. If no README is found, it either returns a default filename (if silent=True) or raises `ReadmeNotFoundError`.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nThe `DirectoryReader` class is a specialized implementation of `ReadmeReader` that handles reading README files from local filesystem directories. Its primary purpose is to locate and read README files either from a specified path or from the current working directory, supporting multiple default README filenames.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/readers.py`, the `DirectoryReader` class inherits from `ReadmeReader` and implements specific directory-based README file handling:\n\n```python\nclass DirectoryReader(ReadmeReader):\n    def __init__(self, path=None, silent=False):\n        super(DirectoryReader, self).__init__()\n        root_filename = os.path.abspath(self._resolve_readme(path, silent))\n        self.root_filename = root_filename\n        self.root_directory = os.path.dirname(root_filename)\n```\n\nThe class provides two key internal methods:\n1. `_find_file()`: Searches for README files in a given path using predefined filenames\n2. `_resolve_readme()`: Determines the actual README file path, handling both direct file paths and directory paths\n\n**Details:**\nThe implementation includes several important features:\n- Supports finding README files using multiple default filenames (referenced as `DEFAULT_FILENAMES`)\n- Handles both explicit file paths and directory paths\n- Provides a \"silent\" mode that returns default values instead of raising exceptions\n- Normalizes paths for consistency\n- Stores both the absolute path of the README file (`root_filename`) and its containing directory (`root_directory`)\n\nThe class is used as the default reader in the `Grip` application (from `grip/app.py`):\n```python\nif source is None or isinstance(source, str_type):\n    source = DirectoryReader(source)\n```\n\n**Limitations:**\nWhile the code context shows the core functionality, a few pieces of information are not visible in the provided snippets:\n1. The actual list of `DEFAULT_FILENAMES` is not shown\n2. The implementation of the `read()` method (inherited from `ReadmeReader`) is not visible\n3.

      "question": "How does Grip handle the rendering of GitHub-style task lists with nested items, and what HTML structure does it generate? \nPlease provide an example of the Markdown input and corresponding HTML output.",
      "reference_answer": "Let me explain how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists by analyzing the test files and HTML output structure:\n\nThe input Markdown for nested task lists looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] a bigger project\n  - [x] first subtask #1234\n  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321\n  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention\n- [x] a separate task\n```\n\nGrip generates specific HTML structure for these task lists, as shown in the test output:\n\n\n```664:666:tests/output/app/gfm-test-user-content.html\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" disabled> a bigger project\n```\n\n\nThe key elements of the HTML structure are:\n\n1. Task lists get the class `task-list`\n2. Each list item gets the class `task-list-item`\n3. Checkboxes are rendered as `input` elements with:\n   - type=\"checkbox\"\n   - class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"\n   - disabled attribute\n   - checked attribute for completed tasks\n\nFor nested lists, Grip maintains the hierarchy by:\n\n\n```466:474:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> a bigger project\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> first subtask #1234</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> follow up subtask #4321</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> final subtask cc @mention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> a separate task</li>\n```\n\n\nThis shows that:\n\n1. The parent list contains the nested list within its `li` element\n2. The nested list maintains all the same task list classes and structure\n3. Each level preserves the checkbox state (checked/unchecked)\n4. References like #1234 and @mention are properly linked in the HTML output\n\nThis implementation matches GitHub's own rendering of task lists, ensuring compatibility and consistent appearance when viewing markdown files either on GitHub or through Grip's local preview.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, I cannot definitively determine how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists with nested items. The code shown does not contain the specific implementation details for task list rendering.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the code provided, we can see that Grip uses GitHub's Markdown API for rendering through the `GitHubRenderer` class in `grip/renderers.py`. The actual rendering is delegated to GitHub's API rather than being handled locally:\n\n```python\nclass GitHubRenderer(ReadmeRenderer):\n    def __init__(self, user_content=None, context=None, api_url=None, raw=None):\n        if api_url is None:\n            api_url = DEFAULT_API_URL\n        super(GitHubRenderer, self).__init__(user_content, context)\n        self.api_url = api_url\n```\n\nThe renderer validates that the input is a Unicode string but delegates the actual markdown processing to GitHub's API. The specific transformation of task lists would happen server-side at GitHub.\n\n**Details:**\nWhile we can't see the exact HTML output from the code provided, since Grip uses GitHub's API, it would generate HTML that matches GitHub's standard rendering. GitHub-style task lists typically follow this pattern:\n\nMarkdown input example:\n```markdown\n- [ ] Parent task\n  - [ ] Nested task 1\n  - [x] Nested task 2\n```\n\nHowever, the actual HTML output structure is not visible in the provided code snippets.\n\n**Limitations:**\nSeveral key pieces of information are missing from the provided code:\n1. The actual API request implementation to GitHub's markdown endpoint\n2. The response handling code that processes GitHub's HTML output\n3. Any custom processing or modifications Grip might make to the rendered HTML\n4. The specific template or structure used to display the final rendered content\n\nTo fully answer this question, we would need to see:\n1. The complete implementation of the `render()` method in `GitHubRenderer`\n2. Any post-processing of the GitHub API response\n3.

      "question": "How does Grip handle GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, and what happens when invalid credentials are provided? Please explain the authentication flow and error handling.",
      "reference_answer": "Based on the codebase, particularly the test mocks implementation, here's how Grip handles GitHub API authentication:\n\nWhen making requests to GitHub's API, Grip uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the following flow:\n\n1. Authentication headers are checked first:\n\n```python:tests/mocks.py\ndef _authenticate(self, request):\n    if 'Authorization' not in request.headers:\n        return None\n    dummy = requests.Request()\n    requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(*self.auth)(dummy)\n    if request.headers['Authorization'] != dummy.headers['Authorization']:\n        return (401, {'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'},\n                '{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}')\n    return None\n```\n\nKey aspects of the authentication handling:\n\n1. If no Authorization header is present, requests are treated as unauthenticated (subject to stricter rate limits)\n2. When credentials are provided, they're validated using HTTP Basic Auth\n3. Invalid credentials result in a 401 response with a JSON error message: `{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}`\n\nThe authentication is important because GitHub's API has rate limiting:\n- Unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour\n- Authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour\n\nThis means that for heavy usage or in environments where you need to render many markdown files, proper authentication is crucial to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\nWhen using Grip, you can provide GitHub credentials either through:\n- Environment variables\n- Command line arguments\n- API configuration\n\nIf invalid credentials are provided, Grip will receive the 401 error from GitHub and fall back to unauthenticated requests, but with the lower rate limit.\n\nThis implementation ensures secure handling of credentials while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's API requirements and rate limiting policies.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip handles GitHub API authentication through basic authentication using a username/password (or token) pair. The authentication is optional, and credentials can be provided either through settings or command-line arguments.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the code snippets, we can see the authentication setup in multiple files:\n\n1. In `settings.py`:\n```python\nUSERNAME = None\nPASSWORD = None\n```\nDefault credentials are set to None, with a note recommending using a personal access token instead of password for security.\n\n2. In `api.py`:\n```python\nauth = (username, password) if username or password else None\n```\nThe authentication tuple is only created if either username or password is provided.\n\n3. In `command.py`, the CLI options show:\n```\n--user=<username> A GitHub username for API authentication\n--pass=<password> A GitHub password or auth token for API auth\n```\n\n**Details:**\nThe authentication flow appears to work as follows:\n\n1. Credentials can be provided through:\n   - Command line arguments (--user and --pass)\n   - Settings configuration\n   - Default settings (which are None)\n\n2. The authentication is passed to the GitHub API through basic auth when making requests\n\n3. The API endpoint can be customized through:\n```python\nAPI_URL = None  # In settings.py\nDEFAULT_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com'  # In constants.py\n```\n\n**Limitations:**\nSeveral important aspects of the authentication handling are not visible in the provided code snippets:\n\n1.

      "question": "How does Grip handle syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks, and what happens when an unmatched language is specified? Explain the rendering process with examples.",
      "reference_answer": "Looking at the test files and HTML output, here's how Grip handles code block syntax highlighting:\n\nWhen processing a markdown code block, Grip generates different HTML structures based on the language specification:\n\n1. For recognized languages, it generates a `highlight` div with language-specific class:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test.html\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">'Hello!'</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'JavaScript!'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n```\n\n2. For unmatched languages, it falls back to a simpler structure:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<pre lang=\"unmatched_language\"><code>console.log('No matching language, but looks like JavaScript.');\n</code></pre>\n```\n\nThe key differences in handling are:\n\n1. Recognized languages:\n   - Get wrapped in a `div` with `highlight` and `highlight-source-{language}` classes\n   - Receive syntax-specific span elements with `pl-` prefixed classes for different code elements\n   - Support proper coloring of syntax elements like strings, functions, and operators\n\n2. Unmatched languages:\n   - Use a simpler `pre` and `code` structure\n   - Include the unmatched language as a `lang` attribute\n   - Don't receive any syntax-specific highlighting\n\nThis matches GitHub's own rendering behavior, ensuring that code blocks look the same whether viewed on GitHub or through Grip's local preview, while gracefully handling unsupported language specifications.\n\nThe syntax highlighting is particularly important for technical documentation, as it makes code examples more readable and helps distinguish different programming languages in the rendered output.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip primarily handles syntax highlighting through two paths: GitHub's API rendering (GitHubRenderer) or offline rendering (OfflineRenderer) using Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension.

GitHubRenderer:\n- Sends markdown content to GitHub's API for rendering\n- Preserves GitHub's native syntax highlighting behavior\n- The actual syntax highlighting implementation is handled by GitHub's backend\n\n2. OfflineRenderer:\n```python\nmarkdown.markdown(text, extensions=[\n    'fenced_code',\n    'codehilite(css_class=highlight)',\n    'toc',\n    'tables',\n    'sane_lists',\n    UrlizeExtension(),\n])\n```\n- Uses Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension\n- Sets CSS class to 'highlight' for styled code blocks\n- Supports fenced code blocks through the 'fenced_code' extension\n\n**Details:**\nThe syntax highlighting process differs depending on the rendering mode:\n\n1. Online (GitHub API) mode:\n- Language detection and highlighting is handled by GitHub's API\n- Maintains consistency with GitHub's website rendering\n- Supports all languages recognized by GitHub's linguist\n\n2.
