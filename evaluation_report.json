      "question": "How do I run grip from command line on a specific port?",
      "reference_answer": "To run Grip from the command line on a specific port, you can specify the port number as an argument. \n\nHere\u2019s how you do it:\n\n$ grip 80\n * Running on http://localhost:80/\n\nThis command starts the Grip server on port 80. You can replace 80 with any desired port number.\n\nreference:\n\n```markdown:README.md\n    You can also specify a port:\n    ```console\n    $ grip 80\n    * Running on http://localhost:80/\n    ```\n```",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code, you can run grip on a specific port by specifying the port number directly as an argument after the path. The syntax would be:\n\n```bash\ngrip [options] [<path>] [<hostname>:]<port>\n```\n\nThis can be seen in the `main()` function in `command.py`, where it processes command line arguments. The code specifically shows that the old style `-p` or `--port` flags are no longer supported, and instead shows an error message:\n\n```python\nif '-p' in argv or '--port' in argv:\n    print('Use grip [options] [<path>] [<hostname>:]<port> instead of -p')\n    print('See grip -h for details')\n    return 2\n```\n\nSo for example, to run grip on port 8080, you would use:\n```bash\ngrip 8080\n```\n\nOr to specify both a path and port:\n```bash\ngrip path/to/file.md 8080\n```\n\nYou can also specify a hostname along with the port:\n```bash\ngrip path/to/file.md localhost:8080\n```\n\nThe code shows that if the port is in use, you'll get an error message:\n```python\nif ex.errno == errno.EADDRINUSE:\n    print('This port is in use. Is a grip server already running? '\n          'Stop that instance or specify another port here.')\n```\n\nNote: While the code shows the command-line interface, the actual usage text (stored in the `usage` variable) is not included in the provided snippets, so there might be additional options available that aren't visible in these code excerpts.\n\nSource files: grip-no-tests/grip/__init__.py, grip-no-tests/grip/__main__.py, grip-no-tests/grip/browser.py, grip-no-tests/grip/command.py",

      "question": "Where does `wait_for_server` function is defined and what is its purpose?",
      "reference_answer": "The `wait_for_server` function, defined in `grip/browser.py`, waits until a local server starts listening on a given host and port. It repeatedly checks using `is_server_running`, sleeping for 0.1 seconds between attempts. If a `cancel_event` is provided and set, it exits early. It returns True when the server is ready. This function is used in `wait_and_start_browser` to ensure the server is running before opening the browser.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, `wait_for_server` is defined in the file `grip-no-tests/grip/browser.py`. Here's a detailed analysis of its purpose and implementation:\n\nPurpose:\nThe function is designed to block execution until a local server becomes available on a specified host and port combination. Specifically, it:\n\n1. Continuously checks if a server is running at the specified host:port\n2. Provides a cancellation mechanism through an optional `cancel_event` parameter\n3. Is primarily intended to be used with a Flask server, as mentioned in its docstring\n\nImplementation:\n```python\ndef wait_for_server(host, port, cancel_event=None):\n    while not is_server_running(host, port):\n        # Stop waiting if shutting down\n        if cancel_event and cancel_event.is_set():\n            return False\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n    return True\n```\n\nThe function works by:\n- Running in a loop that checks server availability using `is_server_running()`\n- Sleeping for 0.1 seconds between checks to prevent CPU overload\n- Allowing cancellation through a cancel_event parameter\n- Returning True when the server is available, or False if cancelled\n\nThe function is used as part of a larger system, particularly in the `wait_and_start_browser` function, which uses it to ensure a server is running before attempting to open a browser to that address.\n\nThis implementation is part of a browser-launching utility that coordinates server startup with browser access, making it useful for development and testing scenarios where you need to ensure a server is ready before attempting to connect to it.\n\nSource files: grip-no-tests/grip/browser.py",

      "question": "How does Grip handle the rendering of GitHub-style task lists with nested items, and what HTML structure does it generate? \nPlease provide an example of the Markdown input and corresponding HTML output.",
      "reference_answer": "Let me explain how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists by analyzing the test files and HTML output structure:\n\nThe input Markdown for nested task lists looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] a bigger project\n  - [x] first subtask #1234\n  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321\n  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention\n- [x] a separate task\n```\n\nGrip generates specific HTML structure for these task lists, as shown in the test output:\n\n\n```664:666:tests/output/app/gfm-test-user-content.html\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" disabled> a bigger project\n```\n\n\nThe key elements of the HTML structure are:\n\n1. Task lists get the class `task-list`\n2. Each list item gets the class `task-list-item`\n3. Checkboxes are rendered as `input` elements with:\n   - type=\"checkbox\"\n   - class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"\n   - disabled attribute\n   - checked attribute for completed tasks\n\nFor nested lists, Grip maintains the hierarchy by:\n\n\n```466:474:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> a bigger project\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> first subtask #1234</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> follow up subtask #4321</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> final subtask cc @mention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> a separate task</li>\n```\n\n\nThis shows that:\n\n1. The parent list contains the nested list within its `li` element\n2. The nested list maintains all the same task list classes and structure\n3. Each level preserves the checkbox state (checked/unchecked)\n4. References like #1234 and @mention are properly linked in the HTML output\n\nThis implementation matches GitHub's own rendering of task lists, ensuring compatibility and consistent appearance when viewing markdown files either on GitHub or through Grip's local preview.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, I can see that Grip handles GitHub-style task lists through a patching mechanism in the `patch()` function, but some of the key implementation details (like the regex patterns INCOMPLETE_TASK_RE and COMPLETE_TASK_SUB) are not shown in the provided code.\n\nWhat we can determine:\n\n1. The task list processing happens in the `patch()` function when `user_content` is False\n2. It uses two regex replacements:\n   - INCOMPLETE_TASK_RE.sub(INCOMPLETE_TASK_SUB, html)\n   - COMPLETE_TASK_RE.sub(COMPLETE_TASK_SUB, html)\n3. This is noted as a temporary solution with a comment \"FUTURE: Remove this once GitHub API renders task lists\"\n4.

This is evidenced by the fact that the OfflineRenderer implementation doesn't show any specific handling for task lists in its extensions list.\n\nTo provide a complete answer about the HTML structure and exact rendering behavior, we would need:\n1. The definitions of the regex patterns (INCOMPLETE_TASK_RE, COMPLETE_TASK_RE)\n2. The substitution patterns (INCOMPLETE_TASK_SUB, COMPLETE_TASK_SUB)\n\nWithout these, I cannot specify exactly how nested task lists are structured in the output HTML.\n\nSource files: grip-no-tests/grip/patcher.py, grip-no-tests/grip/renderers.py",

      "question": "How does Grip handle GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, and what happens when invalid credentials are provided? Please explain the authentication flow and error handling.",
      "reference_answer": "Based on the codebase, particularly the test mocks implementation, here's how Grip handles GitHub API authentication:\n\nWhen making requests to GitHub's API, Grip uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the following flow:\n\n1. Authentication headers are checked first:\n\n```python:tests/mocks.py\ndef _authenticate(self, request):\n    if 'Authorization' not in request.headers:\n        return None\n    dummy = requests.Request()\n    requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(*self.auth)(dummy)\n    if request.headers['Authorization'] != dummy.headers['Authorization']:\n        return (401, {'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'},\n                '{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}')\n    return None\n```\n\nKey aspects of the authentication handling:\n\n1. If no Authorization header is present, requests are treated as unauthenticated (subject to stricter rate limits)\n2. When credentials are provided, they're validated using HTTP Basic Auth\n3. Invalid credentials result in a 401 response with a JSON error message: `{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}`\n\nThe authentication is important because GitHub's API has rate limiting:\n- Unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour\n- Authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour\n\nThis means that for heavy usage or in environments where you need to render many markdown files, proper authentication is crucial to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\nWhen using Grip, you can provide GitHub credentials either through:\n- Environment variables\n- Command line arguments\n- API configuration\n\nIf invalid credentials are provided, Grip will receive the 401 error from GitHub and fall back to unauthenticated requests, but with the lower rate limit.\n\nThis implementation ensures secure handling of credentials while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's API requirements and rate limiting policies.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, I can explain how Grip handles GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, though some implementation details appear to be missing from the context. Here's what we can determine:\n\n1. Authentication Implementation:\n- Authentication is handled through the `render` method in the `GitHubRenderer` class\n- The method accepts an optional `auth` parameter that gets passed directly to the `requests.post()` call\n- The authentication is passed through to GitHub's API endpoints at either:\n  - `{api_url}/markdown` for user content\n  - `{api_url}/markdown/raw` for raw markdown\n\n```python\ndef render(self, text, auth=None):\n    # ...\n    r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data, auth=auth)\n    r.raise_for_status()\n```\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- The code uses `r.raise_for_status()` to handle HTTP errors\n- This will raise `requests.HTTPError` for any unsuccessful HTTP status codes (including authentication failures)\n- The docstring explicitly states that it \"Raises requests.HTTPError if the request fails\"\n\n3. Authentication Flow:\n```python\n# For user content\nurl = '{0}/markdown'.format(self.api_url)\ndata = {'text': text, 'mode': 'gfm'}\nif self.context:\n    data['context'] = self.context\n\n# For raw content\nurl = '{0}/markdown/raw'.format(self.api_url)\n```\n\nWhat's not shown in the provided code:\n1. How the auth credentials are initially collected or configured\n2. Specific handling of rate limit errors\n3. Any retry logic for failed authentication\n4. How the auth parameter is structured (though it's likely using requests' authentication handling)\n\nThe code suggests that authentication is optional (since `auth=None` by default) and follows GitHub's API authentication standards, but the specific implementation of credential management and rate limit handling would likely be in other parts of the codebase not shown here.\n\nThe error handling is relatively simple - it relies on requests' built-in error handling through `raise_for_status()` rather than implementing custom error handling for authentication failures or rate limiting specifically.\n\nSource files: grip-no-tests/grip/__init__.py, grip-no-tests/grip/assets.py, grip-no-tests/grip/patcher.py, grip-no-tests/grip/renderers.py",

      "question": "How does Grip handle syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks, and what happens when an unmatched language is specified? Explain the rendering process with examples.",
      "reference_answer": "Looking at the test files and HTML output, here's how Grip handles code block syntax highlighting:\n\nWhen processing a markdown code block, Grip generates different HTML structures based on the language specification:\n\n1. For recognized languages, it generates a `highlight` div with language-specific class:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test.html\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">'Hello!'</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'JavaScript!'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n```\n\n2. For unmatched languages, it falls back to a simpler structure:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<pre lang=\"unmatched_language\"><code>console.log('No matching language, but looks like JavaScript.');\n</code></pre>\n```\n\nThe key differences in handling are:\n\n1. Recognized languages:\n   - Get wrapped in a `div` with `highlight` and `highlight-source-{language}` classes\n   - Receive syntax-specific span elements with `pl-` prefixed classes for different code elements\n   - Support proper coloring of syntax elements like strings, functions, and operators\n\n2. Unmatched languages:\n   - Use a simpler `pre` and `code` structure\n   - Include the unmatched language as a `lang` attribute\n   - Don't receive any syntax-specific highlighting\n\nThis matches GitHub's own rendering behavior, ensuring that code blocks look the same whether viewed on GitHub or through Grip's local preview, while gracefully handling unsupported language specifications.\n\nThe syntax highlighting is particularly important for technical documentation, as it makes code examples more readable and helps distinguish different programming languages in the rendered output.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, I can explain how Grip handles syntax highlighting for code blocks, though some implementation details are not fully visible in the given context.\n\nHere's what we can determine:\n\n1. Grip offers two main rendering approaches:\n\n- **OfflineRenderer**: Uses pure Python with the Python-Markdown library\n- **GitHubRenderer**: Uses GitHub's API for rendering\n\n2. For the **OfflineRenderer**, syntax highlighting is handled through the following extensions:\n```python\nmarkdown.markdown(text, extensions=[\n    'fenced_code',\n    'codehilite(css_class=highlight)',\n    # other extensions...\n])\n```\n\nSpecifically:\n- The `fenced_code` extension enables support for code blocks using triple backticks (```)\n- The `codehilite` extension handles the actual syntax highlighting, using `highlight` as the CSS class\n\n3. For the **GitHubRenderer**, syntax highlighting is delegated to GitHub's API, as seen in the render method where it sends the markdown content to either:\n- `/markdown` endpoint (for user content)\n- `/markdown/raw` endpoint (for raw markdown)\n\nHowever, the provided code doesn't show:\n1. The actual syntax highlighting implementation details\n2. How different programming languages are mapped to specific highlighting rules\n3. What happens with unmatched languages\n4. The CSS styles used for highlighting\n\nTo provide a complete answer about language handling and unmatched languages, we would need to see:\n- The implementation of the `codehilite` extension\n- Any language mapping configurations\n- The CSS styles used for syntax highlighting\n- Error handling for unknown languages\n\nIf you need specific information about how Grip handles unmatched languages or the exact syntax highlighting process, we would need additional code context, particularly the implementation of the syntax highlighting components and style definitions.\n\nSource files: grip-no-tests/grip/renderers.py",
