      "question": "How does Grip handle the rendering of GitHub-style task lists with nested items, and what HTML structure does it generate? \nPlease provide an example of the Markdown input and corresponding HTML output.",
      "reference_answer": "Let me explain how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists by analyzing the test files and HTML output structure:\n\nThe input Markdown for nested task lists looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] a bigger project\n  - [x] first subtask #1234\n  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321\n  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention\n- [x] a separate task\n```\n\nGrip generates specific HTML structure for these task lists, as shown in the test output:\n\n\n```664:666:tests/output/app/gfm-test-user-content.html\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" disabled> a bigger project\n```\n\n\nThe key elements of the HTML structure are:\n\n1. Task lists get the class `task-list`\n2. Each list item gets the class `task-list-item`\n3. Checkboxes are rendered as `input` elements with:\n   - type=\"checkbox\"\n   - class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"\n   - disabled attribute\n   - checked attribute for completed tasks\n\nFor nested lists, Grip maintains the hierarchy by:\n\n\n```466:474:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> a bigger project\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> first subtask #1234</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> follow up subtask #4321</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> final subtask cc @mention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> a separate task</li>\n```\n\n\nThis shows that:\n\n1. The parent list contains the nested list within its `li` element\n2. The nested list maintains all the same task list classes and structure\n3. Each level preserves the checkbox state (checked/unchecked)\n4. References like #1234 and @mention are properly linked in the HTML output\n\nThis implementation matches GitHub's own rendering of task lists, ensuring compatibility and consistent appearance when viewing markdown files either on GitHub or through Grip's local preview.",

      "question": "How does Grip handle GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, and what happens when invalid credentials are provided? Please explain the authentication flow and error handling.",
      "reference_answer": "Based on the codebase, particularly the test mocks implementation, here's how Grip handles GitHub API authentication:\n\nWhen making requests to GitHub's API, Grip uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the following flow:\n\n1. Authentication headers are checked first:\n\n```python:tests/mocks.py\ndef _authenticate(self, request):\n    if 'Authorization' not in request.headers:\n        return None\n    dummy = requests.Request()\n    requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(*self.auth)(dummy)\n    if request.headers['Authorization'] != dummy.headers['Authorization']:\n        return (401, {'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'},\n                '{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}')\n    return None\n```\n\nKey aspects of the authentication handling:\n\n1. If no Authorization header is present, requests are treated as unauthenticated (subject to stricter rate limits)\n2. When credentials are provided, they're validated using HTTP Basic Auth\n3. Invalid credentials result in a 401 response with a JSON error message: `{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}`\n\nThe authentication is important because GitHub's API has rate limiting:\n- Unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour\n- Authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour\n\nThis means that for heavy usage or in environments where you need to render many markdown files, proper authentication is crucial to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\nWhen using Grip, you can provide GitHub credentials either through:\n- Environment variables\n- Command line arguments\n- API configuration\n\nIf invalid credentials are provided, Grip will receive the 401 error from GitHub and fall back to unauthenticated requests, but with the lower rate limit.\n\nThis implementation ensures secure handling of credentials while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's API requirements and rate limiting policies.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, I can explain some aspects of how Grip handles GitHub API authentication, but there's not enough information to fully describe the authentication flow and error handling.

Authentication credentials:\n   - The code defines USERNAME and PASSWORD variables, which are initially set to None.\n   - There's a comment suggesting users should use a personal access token instead of their GitHub password for security reasons.\n\n2. API URL:\n   - The code defines an API_URL variable, initially set to None.\n   - There's also a DEFAULT_API_URL constant set to 'https://api.github.com', which is the public GitHub API.\n\n3. Configuration:\n   - The code suggests that users can override settings using command-line arguments or by creating a settings_local.py file in the current directory or in ~/.grip/settings.py.\n\nHowever, the provided code doesn't show the actual implementation of the authentication process or how it handles rate limiting and invalid credentials.

Deals with error responses from the API\n\nWithout this information, we can't determine exactly how Grip handles authentication failures or rate limiting errors. The actual implementation of these features would typically be found in other parts of the codebase, such as in API client classes or authentication modules.\n\nTo provide a complete answer, we would need to see the relevant code that interacts with the GitHub API and handles authentication and error responses.\n\nSources: grip/constants.py, grip/settings.py",

      "question": "How does Grip handle syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks, and what happens when an unmatched language is specified? Explain the rendering process with examples.",
      "reference_answer": "Looking at the test files and HTML output, here's how Grip handles code block syntax highlighting:\n\nWhen processing a markdown code block, Grip generates different HTML structures based on the language specification:\n\n1. For recognized languages, it generates a `highlight` div with language-specific class:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test.html\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">'Hello!'</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'JavaScript!'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n```\n\n2. For unmatched languages, it falls back to a simpler structure:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<pre lang=\"unmatched_language\"><code>console.log('No matching language, but looks like JavaScript.');\n</code></pre>\n```\n\nThe key differences in handling are:\n\n1. Recognized languages:\n   - Get wrapped in a `div` with `highlight` and `highlight-source-{language}` classes\n   - Receive syntax-specific span elements with `pl-` prefixed classes for different code elements\n   - Support proper coloring of syntax elements like strings, functions, and operators\n\n2. Unmatched languages:\n   - Use a simpler `pre` and `code` structure\n   - Include the unmatched language as a `lang` attribute\n   - Don't receive any syntax-specific highlighting\n\nThis matches GitHub's own rendering behavior, ensuring that code blocks look the same whether viewed on GitHub or through Grip's local preview, while gracefully handling unsupported language specifications.\n\nThe syntax highlighting is particularly important for technical documentation, as it makes code examples more readable and helps distinguish different programming languages in the rendered output.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, I don't have enough information to fully explain how Grip handles syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks or what happens with unmatched languages. The code snippets mainly show imports and a brief usage description, but don't contain the actual implementation details for syntax highlighting.\n\nHowever, I can provide some insights based on what we can see:\n\n1. Grip uses renderers, specifically GitHubRenderer and OfflineRenderer, as evidenced by the imports:\n   ```python\n   from .renderers import GitHubRenderer, OfflineRenderer\n   ```\n   These renderers are likely responsible for converting markdown to HTML, which may include syntax highlighting.\n\n2. Grip can read from different sources, including directories, stdin, and text files:\n   ```python\n   from .readers import DirectoryReader, StdinReader, TextReader\n   ```\n   This suggests that Grip can handle various input formats.\n\n3. The usage description mentions that Grip can render files or directories containing README.md files.\n\nTo fully answer the question about syntax highlighting and unmatched languages, we would need to see the implementation details of the renderers, particularly the GitHubRenderer. It's likely that Grip uses a syntax highlighting library (such as Pygments or highlight.js) to handle different programming languages, but without seeing the actual code, I can't confirm this or explain the exact process.\n\nFor unmatched languages, a common approach is to fall back to plain text rendering without specific syntax highlighting, but again, I can't confirm if this is how Grip handles it based on the provided code.\n\nTo get a complete answer, we would need to see the implementation of the rendering process, particularly how the markdown is parsed and how code blocks are processed for syntax highlighting.\n\nSources: grip/api.py, grip/command.py",
