You can replace 80 with any desired port number.\n\nreference:\n\n```markdown:README.md\n    You can also specify a port:\n    ```console\n    $ grip 80\n    * Running on http://localhost:80/\n    ```\n```",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nYou can run grip on a specific port by specifying the port number as the second argument after the path. For example:\n```bash\ngrip path/to/file.md 8080\n# or\ngrip path/to/file.md localhost:8080\n```\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the code in `grip/command.py`, the command-line interface documentation shows that grip accepts two optional arguments:\n- `<path>`: the file to render or directory containing README.md\n- `<address>`: can be specified as either just a port number or as `host:port`\n\nThe usage pattern shown in the docstring:\n```\ngrip [options] [<path>] [<address>]\n```\nindicates that both path and address are optional parameters, with address being the second positional argument.\n\n**Details:**\nThe address parameter can be specified in two formats:\n1. Just the port number (e.g., `8080`)\n2. Full host:port combination (e.g., `localhost:8080`)\n\nIf no address is specified, grip will use its default port (typically 6419, though this isn't shown in the provided code snippet).\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The provided code snippet doesn't show the actual port binding implementation or the default port number\n- The complete list of supported options (`[options]`) isn't shown in the provided snippet\n- The validation logic for port numbers (valid range, etc.) isn't visible in the provided code\n\n**Sources:** grip/__init__.py, grip/__main__.py, grip/app.py, grip/command.py, grip/constants.py",

      "question": "Where does `wait_for_server` function is defined and what is its purpose?",
      "reference_answer": "The `wait_for_server` function, defined in `grip/browser.py`, waits until a local server starts listening on a given host and port. It repeatedly checks using `is_server_running`, sleeping for 0.1 seconds between attempts. If a `cancel_event` is provided and set, it exits early. It returns True when the server is ready. This function is used in `wait_and_start_browser` to ensure the server is running before opening the browser.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nThe `wait_for_server` function is defined in `grip/browser.py` and its purpose is to block execution until a server becomes available on the specified host and port. It continuously checks if a server is listening at the given address, with support for cancellation through an optional cancel event.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/browser.py`:\n```python\ndef wait_for_server(host, port, cancel_event=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Blocks until a local server is listening on the specified\n    host and port. Set cancel_event to cancel the wait.\n\n    This is intended to be used in conjunction with running\n    the Flask server.\n    \"\"\"\n    while not is_server_running(host, port):\n        # Stop waiting if shutting down\n        if cancel_event and cancel_event.is_set():\n            return False\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n    return True\n```\n\nThe function is used in conjunction with `wait_and_start_browser` and ultimately `start_browser_when_ready`, which creates a daemon thread to wait for the server to become available before opening a browser window.\n\n**Details:**\n- The function uses a while loop that checks server availability using `is_server_running`\n- It includes a cancellation mechanism through `cancel_event` parameter\n- It has a sleep interval of 0.1 seconds between checks to prevent CPU overuse\n- Returns True if the server becomes available, False if cancelled\n- Used primarily as part of the browser launching functionality in the Grip application\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe code snippets show the complete implementation and usage context. However, it's worth noting that the actual timeout duration isn't configurable - it will keep trying indefinitely unless cancelled through the cancel_event.\n\n**Sources:** grip/api.py, grip/app.py, grip/browser.py, grip/command.py",

They represent the file extensions that GitHub officially supports for markdown files.\n\n**Details:**\n- The extensions are used to create combinations with supported titles (README, Readme, readme, Home)\n- This results in valid filenames like:\n  - README.md\n  - README.markdown\n  - Readme.md\n  - Readme.markdown\n  etc.\n- These extensions are referenced in `__all__` in `grip/__init__.py`, making them part of the public API\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe code snippets don't show where these extensions are actually validated or processed during markdown rendering.

In file reading operations when encountering ENOENT (No such file or directory) errors\n\n**Details:**\nUsage example:\n```python\n# Example 1: Basic usage\nraise ReadmeNotFoundError('/path/to/missing/readme')\n\n# Example 2: With custom message\nraise ReadmeNotFoundError('/path/to/readme', 'Custom error message')\n\n# Example 3: How it's used in the codebase\ntry:\n    readme_path = reader._find_file('/some/path')\nexcept ReadmeNotFoundError as e:\n    print(str(e))  # Will print: \"No README found at /some/path\"\n```\n\nThe exception provides three ways to get the error message:\n1. Custom message if provided\n2. Formatted path message if path is provided\n3. Default strerror from parent class\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe code snippets show the exception definition and usage, but don't provide complete context about:\n1. The full set of README file patterns that are searched for\n2. The complete error handling strategy across the entire application\n3. Whether there are other related exceptions in the error hierarchy\n\n**Sources:** grip/exceptions.py, grip/readers.py",

      "question": "`DirectoryReader` - please explain the purpose of the class.",
      "reference_answer": "The `DirectoryReader` class, defined in `grip/readers.py`, is a subclass of `ReadmeReader` that reads README files from a directory. It locates a README file, normalizes paths, and provides methods to read file content (text or binary), determine file types, and track last modification times. It ensures safe access by preventing traversal outside the root directory. If no README is found, it either returns a default filename (if silent=True) or raises `ReadmeNotFoundError`.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nThe `DirectoryReader` class is a specialized implementation of `ReadmeReader` that handles reading README files from local filesystem directories. Its primary purpose is to locate and read README files either from a specified path or from the current working directory, supporting various default README filenames.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom `grip/readers.py`, the `DirectoryReader` class inherits from `ReadmeReader` and implements specific directory-based README file handling:\n\n```python\nclass DirectoryReader(ReadmeReader):\n    def __init__(self, path=None, silent=False):\n        super(DirectoryReader, self).__init__()\n        root_filename = os.path.abspath(self._resolve_readme(path, silent))\n        self.root_filename = root_filename\n        self.root_directory = os.path.dirname(root_filename)\n```\n\nThe class provides two key internal methods:\n1. `_find_file()`: Searches for README files in a given directory using predefined filenames\n2. `_resolve_readme()`: Resolves the actual README file path, handling both direct file paths and directory paths\n\n**Details:**\nThe implementation includes several important features:\n- Handles both explicit file paths and directory paths\n- Supports silent mode where it returns defaults instead of raising errors\n- Uses absolute paths internally (`os.path.abspath`)\n- Maintains both the root filename and root directory information\n- Works with the current working directory when no path is specified\n- Integrates with the broader Grip application, as seen in `grip/app.py` where it's used as the default source reader\n\nExample usage from `grip/app.py`:\n```python\nif source is None or isinstance(source, str_type):\n    source = DirectoryReader(source)\n```\n\n**Limitations:**\nWhile the code context is fairly complete, a few details are not visible in the provided snippets:\n- The actual list of `DEFAULT_FILENAMES` is not shown\n- The implementation of the read operation itself is not visible\n- Any potential additional methods inherited from `ReadmeReader` that might be overridden are not shown in the snippets\n\n**Sources:** grip/app.py, grip/readers.py",

      "question": "How does Grip handle the rendering of GitHub-style task lists with nested items, and what HTML structure does it generate? \nPlease provide an example of the Markdown input and corresponding HTML output.",
      "reference_answer": "Let me explain how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists by analyzing the test files and HTML output structure:\n\nThe input Markdown for nested task lists looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] a bigger project\n  - [x] first subtask #1234\n  - [ ] follow up subtask #4321\n  - [ ] final subtask cc @mention\n- [x] a separate task\n```\n\nGrip generates specific HTML structure for these task lists, as shown in the test output:\n\n\n```664:666:tests/output/app/gfm-test-user-content.html\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" disabled> a bigger project\n```\n\n\nThe key elements of the HTML structure are:\n\n1. Task lists get the class `task-list`\n2. Each list item gets the class `task-list-item`\n3. Checkboxes are rendered as `input` elements with:\n   - type=\"checkbox\"\n   - class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"\n   - disabled attribute\n   - checked attribute for completed tasks\n\nFor nested lists, Grip maintains the hierarchy by:\n\n\n```466:474:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> a bigger project\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> first subtask #1234</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> follow up subtask #4321</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\"> final subtask cc @mention</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"\" disabled=\"\" class=\"task-list-item-checkbox\" checked=\"\"> a separate task</li>\n```\n\n\nThis shows that:\n\n1. The parent list contains the nested list within its `li` element\n2. The nested list maintains all the same task list classes and structure\n3. Each level preserves the checkbox state (checked/unchecked)\n4. References like #1234 and @mention are properly linked in the HTML output\n\nThis implementation matches GitHub's own rendering of task lists, ensuring compatibility and consistent appearance when viewing markdown files either on GitHub or through Grip's local preview.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, I cannot definitively determine how Grip handles GitHub-style task lists with nested items. The code shows that Grip uses GitHub's Markdown API for rendering (via the GitHubRenderer class), but the specific task list rendering implementation is not visible in the provided code.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nFrom the code snippets, we can see that:\n\n1. In `grip/renderers.py`, the `GitHubRenderer` class is responsible for rendering Markdown content:\n```python\nclass GitHubRenderer(ReadmeRenderer):\n    def render(self, text, auth=None):\n        # Only validates that text is Unicode\n        # Actual rendering implementation not shown\n```\n\n2. The renderer appears to delegate the actual Markdown processing to GitHub's API, as indicated by:\n- The use of `DEFAULT_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com'` in `constants.py`\n- The GitHubRenderer class accepting an `api_url` parameter\n\n**Details:**\nThe actual rendering process would likely involve:\n1. Sending the Markdown content to GitHub's API\n2. Receiving the rendered HTML response\n3. Potentially applying additional styling or processing\n\nHowever, the specific API endpoint used and the transformation process is not visible in the provided code snippets.\n\n**Limitations:**\nSeveral key pieces of information are missing from the provided code:\n1. The actual API endpoint used for Markdown rendering\n2. The complete implementation of the `render()` method in GitHubRenderer\n3. Any specific handling for task lists\n4. The HTML structure generated for task lists\n5. Any client-side JavaScript that might be used to handle task list interactivity\n\nTo provide an accurate example of Markdown input and HTML output for task lists, we would need to see:\n1.

      "question": "How does Grip handle GitHub API authentication for rate limiting, and what happens when invalid credentials are provided? Please explain the authentication flow and error handling.",
      "reference_answer": "Based on the codebase, particularly the test mocks implementation, here's how Grip handles GitHub API authentication:\n\nWhen making requests to GitHub's API, Grip uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the following flow:\n\n1. Authentication headers are checked first:\n\n```python:tests/mocks.py\ndef _authenticate(self, request):\n    if 'Authorization' not in request.headers:\n        return None\n    dummy = requests.Request()\n    requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(*self.auth)(dummy)\n    if request.headers['Authorization'] != dummy.headers['Authorization']:\n        return (401, {'content-type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'},\n                '{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}')\n    return None\n```\n\nKey aspects of the authentication handling:\n\n1. If no Authorization header is present, requests are treated as unauthenticated (subject to stricter rate limits)\n2. When credentials are provided, they're validated using HTTP Basic Auth\n3. Invalid credentials result in a 401 response with a JSON error message: `{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\"}`\n\nThe authentication is important because GitHub's API has rate limiting:\n- Unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour\n- Authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour\n\nThis means that for heavy usage or in environments where you need to render many markdown files, proper authentication is crucial to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\nWhen using Grip, you can provide GitHub credentials either through:\n- Environment variables\n- Command line arguments\n- API configuration\n\nIf invalid credentials are provided, Grip will receive the 401 error from GitHub and fall back to unauthenticated requests, but with the lower rate limit.\n\nThis implementation ensures secure handling of credentials while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's API requirements and rate limiting policies.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip handles GitHub API authentication through basic authentication using a username/password or token combination. The authentication is optional, and credentials can be specified either through settings or command-line arguments.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\n1. From `settings.py`:\n```python\n# Default settings with credentials\nUSERNAME = None\nPASSWORD = None\n```\n\n2. From `command.py`, the CLI supports authentication options:\n```python\n--user=<username> A GitHub username for API authentication\n--pass=<password> A GitHub password or auth token for API auth\n```\n\n3. From `api.py`, the authentication implementation:\n```python\n# Optional basic auth\nauth = (username, password) if username or password else None\n```\n\n**Details:**\nThe authentication flow appears to work as follows:\n\n1. Credentials can be provided through:\n   - Settings file (`settings.py`)\n   - Command line arguments (`--user` and `--pass`)\n   - Environment variables (not shown in provided snippets)\n\n2. The authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Auth, as shown by the tuple creation in `api.py`\n\n3. The API endpoint can be customized through:\n   - Default endpoint: `DEFAULT_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com'`\n   - Custom endpoint via `--api-url` command line option\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe provided code snippets don't show:\n\n1.

      "question": "How does Grip handle syntax highlighting for different programming languages in markdown code blocks, and what happens when an unmatched language is specified? Explain the rendering process with examples.",
      "reference_answer": "Looking at the test files and HTML output, here's how Grip handles code block syntax highlighting:\n\nWhen processing a markdown code block, Grip generates different HTML structures based on the language specification:\n\n1. For recognized languages, it generates a `highlight` div with language-specific class:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test.html\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">'Hello!'</span>)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'JavaScript!'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n```\n\n2. For unmatched languages, it falls back to a simpler structure:\n\n```html:tests/output/renderer/gfm-test-user-context.html\n<pre lang=\"unmatched_language\"><code>console.log('No matching language, but looks like JavaScript.');\n</code></pre>\n```\n\nThe key differences in handling are:\n\n1. Recognized languages:\n   - Get wrapped in a `div` with `highlight` and `highlight-source-{language}` classes\n   - Receive syntax-specific span elements with `pl-` prefixed classes for different code elements\n   - Support proper coloring of syntax elements like strings, functions, and operators\n\n2. Unmatched languages:\n   - Use a simpler `pre` and `code` structure\n   - Include the unmatched language as a `lang` attribute\n   - Don't receive any syntax-specific highlighting\n\nThis matches GitHub's own rendering behavior, ensuring that code blocks look the same whether viewed on GitHub or through Grip's local preview, while gracefully handling unsupported language specifications.\n\nThe syntax highlighting is particularly important for technical documentation, as it makes code examples more readable and helps distinguish different programming languages in the rendered output.",
      "generated_answer": "**Answer:**\nBased on the provided code snippets, Grip primarily handles syntax highlighting through two paths: GitHub's API rendering (GitHubRenderer) or offline rendering (OfflineRenderer) using Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension.

GitHubRenderer:\n- Sends markdown content to GitHub's API for rendering\n- Preserves GitHub's native syntax highlighting behavior\n- The actual syntax highlighting implementation is handled by GitHub's backend\n\n2. OfflineRenderer:\n```python\nreturn markdown.markdown(text, extensions=[\n    'fenced_code',\n    'codehilite(css_class=highlight)',\n    'toc',\n    'tables',\n    'sane_lists',\n    UrlizeExtension(),\n])\n```\n- Uses Python-Markdown with the 'codehilite' extension\n- Sets CSS class to 'highlight' for styled code blocks\n- Supports fenced code blocks through the 'fenced_code' extension\n\n**Details:**\nThe syntax highlighting process differs depending on the renderer:\n\n1. With GitHubRenderer:\n- Language detection and highlighting are handled by GitHub's API\n- Unmatched languages likely fall back to GitHub's default handling\n- The actual implementation details are abstracted away in GitHub's service\n\n2. With OfflineRenderer:\n- Highlighting is handled by Python-Markdown's codehilite extension\n- The extension typically uses Pygments for syntax highlighting\n- Unmatched languages would likely be rendered as plain text blocks\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe provided code snippets don't show:\n1.
